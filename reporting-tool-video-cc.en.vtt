Universities and school districts are collecting
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.700

2 
more data than ever before. 
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.500

3 
This data is priceless. 
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.600

4 
The big question is, do we make the 
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.600 

5 
best usage of big data in education?
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000

6 
Big data is a key to
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.800

7 
understanding how students students are learning. 
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.900

8 
Data driven education relies on academic assessment 
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.300

9 
as an integral part of continuous development.
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.100

10
Whether you report your assessment findings for internal
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.100

11
or accreditation purposes, there has been a common
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.800

12
problem with data scattered between different sources.
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.700

13
Scattered data makes it very time consuming and 
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.500

14
in some cases, impossible to analyze and visualize. 
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.900

15
This problem puts a burden on teachers and administrators 
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.800

16
to make the best use of their data. 
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.800

17
In some cases, it prevents institutions 
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.200

18
from seeing the big picture.
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900
