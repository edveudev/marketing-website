00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.700
Universities and school districts are collecting


2 
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.500
more data than ever before. 


3 
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.600
This data is priceless. 


4 
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.600 
The big question is, do we make the 


5 
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000
best usage of big data in education?


6 
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.800
Big data is a key to


7 
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.900
understanding how students students are learning. 


8 
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.300
Data driven education relies on academic assessment 


9 
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.100
as an integral part of continuous development.


10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.100
Whether you report your assessment findings for internal


11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.800
or accreditation purposes, there has been a common


12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.700
problem with data scattered between different sources.


13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.500
Scattered data makes it very time consuming and 


14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.900
in some cases, impossible to analyze and visualize. 


15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.800
This problem puts a burden on teachers and administrators 


16
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.800
to make the best use of their data. 


17
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.200
In some cases, it prevents institutions 


18
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900
from seeing the big picture.


19
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.200
